Hi! Welcome to my Homepage!

# About Me

I am currently a master student at the Knowledge Computing Lab (KCL) of Peking University (PKU). I completed my undergraduate studies at the Kuang Yaming Honors School, Nanjing University. My research interests include natural language processing, large language models, in-context learning and out-of-distribution generalization.
