Hi! Welcome to my Homepage!
I am now a third year undergraduate student from Kuang Yaming Honors School, Nanjing University. I am going to pursue the master's degree at the Knowledge Computing Lab (KCL), Peking University (PKU) in the fall of 2024. My research interests include natural language processing, machine learning and out-of-distribution generalization.

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
